# 10-Days-Of-ML
Embark on a focused journey to master the fundamentals of Machine Learning in just 10 days! This repository is designed to be a structured guide for both beginners and intermediate learners, offering daily challenges, hands-on coding exercises, and conceptual explanations to build strong ML foundations.

What's Inside:
- Day 1-3: Data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Day 4-6: Understanding core algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
- Day 7-8: Diving into advanced concepts like support vector machines, ensemble methods, and regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso).
- Day 9: Unsupervised learning with clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Day 10: Real-world project combining multiple techniques for end-to-end implementation.

Features:
- Step-by-step explanations
- Code examples in Python
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks
- Challenges and quizzes for reinforcement
